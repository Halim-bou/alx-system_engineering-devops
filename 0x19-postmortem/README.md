**Postmortem: Nginx Outage - The Case of the Mysterious 404s**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** April 10, 2024, from 8:00 AM to 10:30 AM (UTC-5).
- **Impact:** During the outage, our web application experienced intermittent 404 errors.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was traced back to a misconfiguration in the Nginx server's routing rules.

**Timeline:**
- **8:00 AM:** Issue detected as monitoring system flagged intermittent 404 errors.
- **8:15 AM:** Engineering team alerted by monitoring system.
- **8:30 AM:** Investigated database and application server for potential issues.
- **9:00 AM:** Noticed unusual traffic patterns in Nginx access logs.
- **9:30 AM:** Discovered misconfiguration in Nginx routing rules causing requests to be directed to non-existent endpoints.
- **10:00 AM:** Incident escalated to senior engineers for further investigation.
- **10:30 AM:** Issue resolved by correcting the misconfiguration in Nginx routing rules.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The issue stemmed from an erroneous regex pattern in the Nginx configuration file, causing valid requests to be redirected to non-existent endpoints. To fix the issue, the regex pattern was updated to accurately route requests to the appropriate endpoints.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following actions will be taken:
- **Review Nginx Configuration:** Conduct a thorough review of all Nginx configuration files to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
- **Implement Automated Testing:** Introduce automated tests to validate Nginx configuration changes before deploying them to production.
- **Enhance Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time alerts for abnormal traffic patterns and server errors.
- **Documentation Update:** Update documentation to ensure clarity and consistency in Nginx configuration practices.

**Conclusion:**
The Nginx outage highlighted the critical importance of meticulous configuration management and proactive monitoring. By addressing the root cause and implementing preventative measures, we aim to strengthen our infrastructure's resilience and ensure uninterrupted service delivery for our customers.
